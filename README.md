Creating a bot that listen to btc price and interact to an smart contract
Here is a general outline of the steps involved:

Set up a connection to a Bitcoin price API and fetch the current price.
Create a Web3 instance to connect to the Ethereum network where the smart contract is deployed.
Load the smart contract ABI and contract address into the Web3 instance.
Write a function that checks the current Bitcoin price and triggers a smart contract transaction if the price meets a certain condition.
Use an event listener to call the function periodically and check for the condition.
